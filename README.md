# Twitter Sentiment Intensity Analyzer
**Analyzes the replies of Twitter users to determine sentiment intensity**  
<br />

**Don't plan on upgrading this even further, since its use cases are very limited and I no longer have interest in this project**___
**TODO:**
* Experiment with different model(s) to improve accuracy
* Give user option to enter Twitter handles
* Give user option to use Twitter API or a json file
* Predict time based off data size
* Make gui (maybe)<br /><br />  

**REQUIREMENTS:**
* nltk, tweepy, prettytable
* Twitter API credentials if they are used (required now)
* Python 3.5+
