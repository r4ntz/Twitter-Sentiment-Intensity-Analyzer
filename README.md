# Twitter Sentiment Intensity Analyzer
**Analyzes the replies of Twitter users to determine sentiment intensity**

Still a work in progress. Should be functioning very soon.

**TODO:**
     -Perform the actual analysis
     -Test and debug read_data functionality
     -Experiment with larger data sets to determine accuracy
     -Give user option to enter Twitter handles
     -Give user option to determine data set size
     -Give user option to use Twitter API or a json file
     -Predict time based off data size
     -Make gui (maybe)

**REQUIREMENTS:**
     -nltk and tweepy libraries
     -Twitter API credentials if they are used (required now)
     -Python 3.5+
